The check-in was quick and efficient. After traveling for 13 hours on a plane, your brain doesn't actually work properly. Combine that with seasonal allergies and I wasn't even sure where I was. The receptionist was super nice and outgoing. We had a great conversation and he made me really excited about my trip. The housekeeping staff were also really nice! We like to sleep late so we would often leave the Do Not Disturb sign on, but one of the housekeeping staff saw me in the hallway and let me grab some fresh towels and toiletries. The hotel is within walking distance from the beach and the strip. It's kind of off to the side so you don't hear the noise from the street at night. I had a city view room, which was nice and cozy and perfect for two people. I wasn't expecting to have a lanai so I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other guests.","positiveRemarks":"What I liked the best about this hotel was the location and the staff!

We loved the location near the Zoo, beach and places to eat.  The staff was very friendly, super helpful and the rooms were very clean.  There is a small fridge in each room.  It is an older hotel and the windows need upgrading but over all it was lovely.  There is an Expedia Expert on property who was extremely helpful in getting us on excursions.  We booked Whale Watching, Deep Sea Fishing, a car rental and a Luau.  There is only Valet parking at the hotel which is pricey but you can park your car on the street for free.  There was also a little surf shop you can rent body boards and surf boards from on property.  His prices are more reasonable than the vendors that rent the boards on the beach.  My dad rented a body board for all day and into the next day he even gave my two sons a body board each to use at no charge.  There is also a shop to rent bikes, a little gift shop, a coffee shop and a laundry facility (located downstairs) as well.  An ABC store (convenance store/gift store) is just down the street.  The pool isn't big but we enjoyed it.  The Happy Hour drinks were yummy!  \r\nMake sure you ask about the hotel-airport service on your check out.

Queen Kapiolani met our expecations.   Staff was excellent.  We would like to give an extra thank you to Stason who was so friendly from our first day to our last day remembering us everyday that he was working greeted us and got us our chairs and towels. He really seemed to love his job and made us feel so good everytime we saw him. My only complaint would be the windows.  We had a corner room which was excellent, roomy and very comfortable, however the windows on one wall were louvered and allow alot of street noise.  It didn't bother us too much as we expect more noise in Waikiki. We had a fantastic holiday. The beach chairs were great and only had 1 day that they had none left by the time we came downstairs.  We were a little dissapointed that we were charged an additional $2.00 per bag for storage after checkout.  We have always tipped for this service and never have had to pay a fee per bag.  We did pay the resort fee which we would have thought would have included this service except for the tip. ","positiveRemarks":"We really liked the hotel.  Our only complaint would be the windows.
